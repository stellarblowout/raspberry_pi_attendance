# raspberry_pi_attendance
Raspberry Pi attendace system that I set up in 2020 for my Automatic Data Capture course.

This is a project that I completed to better understand how RFID sensors play a role in the industry today. However, through completing this project in full, it introduced me to a broad range of related areas in hardware and software such as the setup and installation of Python 3 and SQL from a CLI, installing and updating packages from a CLI, locating IP and MAC addresses within a network through the use of ARP commands, building a RFID reader circuit with a strong understanding of breadboard vs. GPIO pin functionality, ability to interpret wire diagrams, and just simply trobleshooting common issues. From bar coding to bluetooth, the internet of things is a diverse subject, so this project highlights most of the requirements necessary to set up a similar system. I navigated through the directions from Pi up my life and this project is the proof of its functionality. The two options for displaying data on this project were through the use of a simple web interface or from an embedded LCD. This project follows the Web Interface option to display data. All code was cloned from Github and can be found in the link below for reference.
